## CLI Language Model - Fine-tuned DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite

This repository contains a notebook for fine-tuning of DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite, optimized for generating command-line interface (CLI) tools and automation scripts.

The model was trained on a custom dataset containing real-world examples of Bash scripts, Python CLI apps using argparse/click, Dockerfiles, Git workflows, and API-based terminal tools. It is designed to help developers scaffold CLI projects, automate tasks, and improve productivity directly from the terminal.

Ideal for students working with scripting, DevOps, system administration, or building lightweight CLI-based tools.
